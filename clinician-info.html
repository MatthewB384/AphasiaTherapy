            Information for Clinicians



            About the website:



            The Phono-factory is a free website containing therapy materials for adults with aphasia and/or apraxia of
            speech. It
            was developed as a HSC school project by Matthew Banney, as part of an assignment in coding/website
            development.
            Clinical content was supplied by the speech pathology department of the John Hunter Hospital.



            When users have completed therapy tasks from the website, a record of their scores will be stored locally,
            so that they
            (or their clinician) can track their performance. Users can see only the data for tasks that were completed
            on the
            device they used to access the therapy.



            About the therapy:



            Phonological Components Analysis (PCA)



            Originally the work of Leonard, Rochon & Laird (2008), PCA is a phonologically based treatment for naming
            deficits in
            aphasia. It was modelled after the semantic feature analysis (SFA) approach (Boyle & Coelho, 1995) and has
            been
            demonstrated to be an effective approach to improving word retrieval for treated and untreated word
            vocabulary (Leonard
            et al, 2008; van Hees et al, 2013; Leonard et al, 2015). It promotes activation of the phonological level of
            the lexical
            system from the semantic level. Preliminary results suggest that PCA may be more beneficial than SFA for
            patients who
            have deficits in the semantic system (van Hees et al, 2013), as well as being useful for patients with
            post-semantic
            impairments (van Hees et al, 2013).

            The original therapy requires the patient to name a picture (if they can) and then identify phonological
            components
            related to the target item (rhymes with…, first sound, first sound associates, final sound, number of
            syllables).

            For the purpose of creating the interactive therapy materials on this website, which can be completed
            independently by
            users, an adapted version of the therapy has been presented in this website, maintaining the principles of
            active
            engagement of the user with the therapy stimulus and deeper processing of the stimulus materials (Leonard et
            al, 2015).





            Implicit Phoneme Manipulation (IPM)



            With some intriguing similarities to PCA, implicit phoneme manipulation is a therapy that requires phoneme
            manipulation
            (but not verbal production), and is hypothesized to activate motor planning within the cortex. The
            developers of the
            therapy (Davis, Farias & Baynes, 2009) proposed that repeated implicit (non-verbal) practice of retrieving
            and
            internally monitoring sounds may improve the efficiency of transition between phonological plans and the
            initial phase
            of motor planning. They proposed that the intervention could therefore target apraxia of speech and improve
            speech
            production without the need for overt (verbal) practice. The therapy used in their preliminary studies
            required implicit
            manipulation of phonemes through rhyming, deletion, and alliteration tasks (Davis et al, 2009), and blending
            (Farias et
            al, 2013), and was delivered via a computer program. Participants selected picture-based responses on the
            screen and
            were discouraged from verbally attempting the target words. Though the data available on this approach is
            insufficient
            in scale to be compelling, preliminary results supported the hypothesis that implicit phoneme manipulation
            improves
            accuracy of word production in subjects with apraxia of speech.

            The therapy presented on this website is based on the materials described by the researchers, with
            adaptations.

            Given the overlap between IPM and PCA activities, the IPM materials have theoretical potential to be
            beneficial to
            people with aphasic word retrieval difficulties.
