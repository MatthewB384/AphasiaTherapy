            <h2>About the website</h2>
            <p>The Phono-factory is a free website containing therapy materials for adults with aphasia and/or apraxia
                of speech. It was developed by Matthew Banney, as a HSC major work project in Software Design and
                Development. Clinical content was supplied by the speech pathology department of the John
                Hunter Hospital.</p>
            <p>When users have completed therapy tasks from the website, a record of their scores will be stored
                locally, so that they (or their clinician) can track their performance. Users can see only the data for
                tasks that were completed on the device they used to access the therapy.</p><br>
            <h2>About the therapy</h2>
            <h3>Phonological Components Analysis (PCA)</h3>
            <p>Originally the work of <i>Leonard, Rochon & Laird (2008)</i>, PCA is a phonologically based treatment for
                naming deficits in aphasia. It was modelled after the semantic feature analysis (SFA) approach <i>(Boyle
                    & Coelho, 1995)</i> and has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to improving word
                retrieval for
                treated and untreated word vocabulary <i>(Leonard et al, 2008; van Hees et al, 2013; Leonard et al,
                    2015)</i>.</p>
            <p>PCA promotes activation of the phonological level of the lexical system from the semantic level.
                Preliminary results suggest that PCA may be more beneficial than SFA for patients who have deficits in
                the semantic system <i>(van Hees et al, 2013)</i>, as well as being
                useful for patients with post-semantic impairments (van Hees et al, 2013).</p>
            <p>The original therapy requires the patient to name a picture (if they can) and then identify phonological
                components related to the target item (rhymes with…, first sound, first sound associates, final sound,
                number of syllables).</p>
            <p>For the purpose of creating the interactive therapy materials on this website, which can be completed
                independently by users, an adapted version of the therapy has been developed,
                maintaining the principles of active engagement of the user with the therapy stimulus and deeper
                processing of the stimulus materials <i>(Leonard et al, 2015).</i></p>
            <h3>Implicit Phoneme Manipulation (IPM)</h3>
            <p>With some intriguing similarities to PCA, implicit phoneme manipulation is a therapy that requires
                phoneme manipulation (but not verbal production), and is hypothesized to activate motor planning within
                the cortex. The developers of the therapy <i>(Davis, Farias & Baynes, 2009)</i> proposed that repeated
                implicit (non-verbal) practice of retrieving and internally monitoring sounds may improve the efficiency
                of transition between phonological plans and the initial phase of motor planning. They proposed that the
                intervention could therefore target apraxia of speech and improve speech production without the need for
                overt (verbal) practice. The therapy used in their preliminary studies required implicit manipulation of
                phonemes through rhyming, deletion, and alliteration tasks <i>(Davis et al, 2009)</i>, and blending
                <i>(Farias et al, 2013)</i>, and was delivered via a computer program. Participants selected
                picture-based responses on the screen and were discouraged from verbally attempting the target words.
                Though the data available on this approach is insufficient in scale to be compelling, preliminary
                results supported the hypothesis that implicit phoneme manipulation improves accuracy of word production
                in subjects with apraxia of speech.
            </p>
            <p>The therapy presented on this website is based on the materials described by the researchers, with
                adaptations.</p>
            <p>Given the overlap between IPM and PCA activities, the IPM materials have theoretical potential to be
                beneficial to people with aphasic word retrieval difficulties.</p>
